            Some weeks ago Pixeloo did his great untoonings of{' '}
            <a href="http://pixeloo.blogspot.com/2008/03/super-real-mario-world.html">
              Mario
            </a>{' '}
            and{' '}
            <a href="http://pixeloo.blogspot.com/2008/03/homer-simpson-untooned.html">
              Homer
            </a>
            . This inspired me to try something similar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Pixeloo I also wanted to use Photoshop. But I didn&#8217;t
            wanted to use any Photos. I just wanted to paint the whole thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Addition I not just wanted to lay a realistic texture over the
            original figure, but to rework the forms and proportions as well, to
            get the whole creature a more realistic look. This isn&#8217;t a
            untooning of bowser, it&#8217;s a redesign. How would he look like
            if he would be a real animal.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I changed some of his proportions here and there I still
            wanted to keep his overall character. My redesign is a bowser who is
            a bit more slender with a narrower mouth that resembles a dinosaur.
            All this to give him a more realistic, faster and threatening look.
            I also took the original color scheme of Bowser and tried to convert
            it into some kind of realistic animal coloration.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this picture I only used the Photoshop Brushtool (99% a simple
            round brush) and sometimes the smudge tool. I never used more than
            two layers at once, trying to work much like painting as possible.
