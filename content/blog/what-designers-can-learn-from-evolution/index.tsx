        Designing means to plan and create something on purpose to solve a
        specific problem. Evolution has no purpose, it doesn&rsquo;t plan, but
        in the end it breeds all different kind of organisms, which are able to
        solve certain problems. Even though design has a cause and evolution
        doesn&rsquo;t, in the end they are both the reason for the solution of a
        problem, thus they achieve the same thing. Therefore a closer look at
        evolution can teach you a lot about what design is, how it works, what
        it can achieve and what not..

        <h4>Evolution</h4>
        <p>
          Evolution is based upon two basic principles: Heredity and Variation.
          Hereditable traits are characteristics of an organism that are passed
          from one generation to the next. They are controlled by the genes on
          the DNA. Variations in these traits can occur through mutation of a
          gene and by recombining them (by sexual reproduction). Because some
          traits are controlled by multiple genes, recombination can lead to new
          and advantageous combinations.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="sixwide">
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>
          Ideas are the genes of design. Every design is based upon ideas or
          concepts that have been there before. Inspiration is the search for
          these ideas to combine, it&rsquo;s the heredity of design. Finding a
          new combinations of ideas is called invention. Finding the ideas
          itself is called discovery. Even the invention of the wheel
          wasn&rsquo;t neither the invention of round things, nor of rolling
          things. It was just the discovery of the concept that something round
          can roll and inventing a way to utilize this to fulfill a purpose.

      </p>
      <div className="sixwide">
        <h4>Evolution</h4>
        <p>
          Evolution won&rsquo;t breed something that sucks. If something is
          really bad and doesn&rsquo;t work it takes evolution about one
          generation to get rid of it. Even if an animal would think, that it
          would be really cool to have no mouth at all, it wouldn&rsquo;t stand
          a chance, since it would be completely unviable. Thereby it
          wouldn&rsquo;t be able to produce offsprings that can pass on the
          crackpot ability of having no mouth. This is called natural selection.
          It doesn&rsquo;t matter what a good idea something might sound like,
          the only thing that matters is, if it&rsquo;s an advantage or not. If
          it‘s a disadvantage nature will get rid of it. Nature never tries to
          fool itself.
          <br />
          This trail and error may seems a bit inefficient, but it&rsquo;s as
          bulletproof as it can get, when it comes to check if a system works as
          a whole.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="sixwide">
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>
          What natural selection is to evolution, supply and demand is to
          design. If nobody wants it, it won&rsquo;t last. Most ideas are
          dropped right after they came up, because they are obviously bullshit.
          In nature this would be called stillbirth. On the other way around, if
          something turns out to be pretty good it can win recognition, will be
          reproduced and influence other designers, thereby become a trend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantage of design is, that ideas are seldom lost forever. You
          don&rsquo;t need a direct line of heritage for a design, since every
          idea in the world can be combined with each other, as long as somebody
          remembers it. Also designers seem to have an advantage over evolution,
          since they can consciously work toward a certain problem. On the other
          hand this bears the risk of forgetting to concern about something. You
          can only look at a few properties at a time, while it&rsquo;s hard to
          check a product as a whole. Nevertheless it should somehow be done.

          Some animals show traits, that seem to be disadvantageous in the first
          place. The huge tail of the peacock makes him easily recognizable to
          predators and handicaps him in his ability to fly. The reason for
          developing this apparent disadvantage is sexual selection. The peahen
          just loves her peacocks with a hugh, flashy tail. Her selection
          benefits a trait of their species, that actual should be obviously
          supposed to die out. This shows that evolution doesn&rsquo;t support
          the individual with the best chances to survive, but the ones with the
          best chances to reproduce. Just being able to totally not get killed
          isn&rsquo;t enough if you got no offsprings to pass on this ability.

        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>
          In design something really similar occurs. Several objects just simply
          suck. Nevertheless everybody seems to want them. The reason why these
          pieces of crap sell anyway is advertising and looking like a good
          deal. This can make people want a product no matter what a huge pile
          of shit it is. Designers like to complain about this situation,
          however it can&rsquo;t be changed. The ability of a product to appeal
          and to sell is as much part of its quality as everything else. Just
          being awesome isn&rsquo;t enough if nobody wants you.

          Eyes are a fine invention. You can see the world around you with them.
          Now let&rsquo;s assume nature wouldn&rsquo;t pay attention and put
          those eyes on the back of an animals head. It always would have to
          turn around to see something and won&rsquo;t see where it&rsquo;s
          walking. Sounds pretty implausible, doesn&rsquo;t it? No matter how
          awesome something is: if you can&rsquo;t use it, it&rsquo;s vain.
          Nature never ignores this. A chain is only as strong as its weakest
          link and evolution will make sure, nothing is wasted just because some
          part of the product is a little less elaborated.

      <div className="sixwide">
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>
          Usability shouldn&rsquo;t be misunderstood as something like a nice
          feature. “Oh we could add some usability here, maybe people will enjoy
          this.” It&rsquo;s the key concept of design. No matter how good
          something is, if you can&rsquo;t use it, there&rsquo;s no use in it.
          If it&rsquo;s only barely usable, than it&rsquo;s also only barely
          good. One good idea alone will get you nowhere. It&rsquo;s the whole
          package that counts. This idea is really not that hard to understand,
          however some designers think they can ignore it, as if nobody would
          notice when it&rsquo;s a pain in the ass to use something.

          Ever wondered why there&rsquo;s no super-strong animal that can crush
          an elephant with its jaws? You should note, that the ability to crush
          an elephant with your jaws requires quite an amount of energy.
          Carrying around such an enormous jaw also requires energy. So you just
          don&rsquo;t have to crush the elephant, foremost you have to find him.
          Again evolution takes great care, that its spawns work as economically
          as possible, since being ineffective is no good trait. Enormous jaws
          are of little use when you&rsquo;re dying of starvation because
          you&rsquo;re out of elephants.

          It&rsquo;s no secret, how important it&rsquo;s to have a look at the
          costs of something. If it&rsquo;s too expensive, nobody will be able
          to afford it, if it&rsquo;s too cheap the quality will suffer.
          What&rsquo;s most likely to be forgotten is, that there are other
          resources, that aren&rsquo;t unlimited and should also be considered.
          Time, attention or nerves are just a few of them. Keep it simple
          stupid.

          Creatures that live in water are quit uncreative. Nearly everybody
          there looks the same. Fish, dolphins, whales, as well as ichthyosaur
          came up with basically the same streamlined body and paddle-like
          flippers or fins. They aren&rsquo;t copycats, it just turns out that
          this is a pretty good way to move through water. Nature doesn&rsquo;t
          try to be creative just for the sake of it. Under similar
          circumstances organisms will most likely develop analogous solutions
          for a problem. This is called convergent evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, species in the same eco system can develop varying
          traits. By this divergent evolution they can specialize to fill in
          different ecological niches.

          Sometimes different people come up with the same idea. This is often
          blamed as stealing, even if it was by accident and happened completely
          independently from each other. While it can be comprehended that
          it&rsquo;s not nice to steal a whole product to compete with the
          initial inventor, there&rsquo;s little sense in not doing something
          that has proven of value, just because it&rsquo;s been done before. On
          the other hand the best solutions are often specially crafted for a
          certain problem or are solving problems no one else has thought about
          before.

          Nothing can last forever. No matter how good creatures have adapted to
          their environment, sooner or later things will change and everything
          will be put on trail. Either the solutions are flexible enough to work
          under these altered circumstances, or evolution must work quickest
          possible to adapt to the new conditions. No matter how good something
          works in a given environment, when rapid change is happening, it will
          be endangered to struck out if it can&rsquo;t handle it.

          Designers have a great advantage over evolution: sometimes they might
          be able to predict a change before it&rsquo;s happening, enabling
          their product to handle a new situation before it&rsquo;s occurred.
          However this is not always possible. To create something that&rsquo;s
          persistent, you must find solutions that are flexible. The more you
          specialized something is, the greater the chances are that it will
          fails even after the slightest shift. It&rsquo;s the job of the
          designer to balance specialization and flexibility against each other.

          even try to reach a higher complexity, it sometimes even decreases
          complexity. Even if men like to think so, there&rsquo;s nothing like

          certain problems, but no ultimate answer to everything or even a best
          answer to something. There&rsquo;s no universal good or bad, it only

        No matter how good one aspect of an idea might be, when you become
        dazzled by its awesomeness and thereby oversee something else it can be
        totally wasted. You always must perceive something as a whole. The
        quality of something can&rsquo;t be judged by a single part. Also keep
        in mind that quality doesn&rsquo;t depend on how good you think it is,
        but on how good it turns out to be. Unlike nature you can&rsquo;t always
        check everything again and again, so it&rsquo;s important to stay honest
        to yourself and always keep critical. Fooling yourself will get you
        nowhere. Knowing your bounds is important if you want to push them.
