        Star Wars didn&rsquo;t just became famous for its story or
        special-effects. The role of its groundbreaking designs shouldn&rsquo;t
        be underestimated. Here are 10 reasons why the concept arts are
        masterpieces and what they can teach you about good concept-art.
      </p>
      <h2 id="proportion">
        <em>Reason &#8470;10</em> Proportion
      </h2>
      <p>
        The effects of good proportions seem to be pretty subtle, but well
        balanced and harmonic proportions can make the difference between a good
        and a bad design
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people would say that they never noticed “good proportions” in Star
        Wars, but it isn&#8217;t important to make them mind-blowing, it just
        suffices to avoid messing them up (which is hard enough). Still you can
        greatly convey some things like scale via proportions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to know what the designs would look like if the concept
        artists would have failed on the proportions you should take a look at
        some merchandising products, which often alter the proportion, for
        example to let action figures fit in them.

        <p>
          The All Terrain Armored Transport is a good example of how to convey a
          sense of scale through proportions. Even without an object of
          comparison you can guess that they must be pretty large due to their
          long legs and the ratio between the head-cockpit and the body.
        </p>
        <p>

          affects the look of the whole thing just have a look at{' '}

        <p>
          There are many interesting things about the proportions of the Falcon.
          The fuselage is extremely flat, and the cockpit is rather small. This
          creates a great suspense and gives the ship a unique look. It also
          conveys the scale of the ship really good.
        </p>
        <p>
          How well balanced these proportions are, can be seen if you for
          example just extend the cockpit a little bit, like on{' '}

        <h3>Sandcrawler</h3>
        <p>
          The proportions of the Sandcrawlers are playing with our experiences.
          Normal track vehicles are rather flat and have a low barycenter. But
          this one is just a huge, massive block sitting on four comparatively
          small tracks, which gives the Sandcrawler a great feeling of mass and
          a thrilling instable look. Which is intensified even more by the
          slightly overhanging cockpit.
        </p>
        <p>
          It just lives up to its name by looking like a massive vehicle that
          really crawls through the sand. And this is achieved nearly completely
          by mere proportion.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>
        <em>Reason &#8470;9</em> Clear Forms
      </h2>
      <p>
        Clear form doesn&#8217;t have to mean simple design. The designs in Star
        Wars are just an great example for this. No matter how many small
        details and attachments there are, they never distract from the overall
        form, at best they support it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes sure that the look doesn&#8217;t have to rely on detail but
        works also from a great distance.
      </p>
      <div className="fourwide">
        <div>

          In fact its just an triangular arrow with a flat cuboid on it. Over
          this one is another longish cuboid. And on top of that are two small
          bowls.
        </p>
        <p>
          All forms of the Imperial Star Destroyer are just following a
          hierarchy and there are no two forms which compete which each other.
          This hierarchy allows all these little details while neither
          distracting from the overall look and the dynamic of the forms, nor
          looking like a simple form upon which details are affixed.

        <h3>Death Star</h3>

          enough to blow up an entire planet? By making it look like a planet.
          Build of steel. No other form could convey the unbelievable size and
          power of this, than the simplest of all forms. A Sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without any attachments, towers, bridges or anything else setting
          itself apart, there is nothing that could give you a sense of scale,
          which seems to be the best way to make something look mind-boggling
          huge.

          it&#8217;s simple.

      </div>
      <h2>
        <em>Reason &#8470;8</em> Contrast
      </h2>
      <p>
        Contrast isn&#8217;t restricted to the contrast between light and dark
        or between colors. There can be all kinds of contrasts:
        big&nbsp;–&nbsp;small, thick&nbsp;–&nbsp;thin, hard&nbsp;–&nbsp;soft,
        round&nbsp;–&nbsp;angular, soft&nbsp;–&nbsp;rough,
        opaque&nbsp;–&nbsp;transparent, plane&nbsp;–&nbsp;voluminous and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great design always depends on some kind of contrast and contrast can be
        found nearly everywhere. Important is just how you use it. The best way
        to convey something really strong is to put its opposite next to it. The
        darkest black will be achieved with white besides. Contrasts are also a
        great way to avoid something look boring.

        </div>
        <h3>Boba Fett</h3>
        <p>
          I wouldn&#8217;t dare to say that Boba is such a cool badass because
          of all the contrast, but there is a lot of contrast going on, which
          might at least explain why he looks so cool. His armor is made of all
          different materials and colors. He has this clumsy helmet contrasted
          by the small antenna on one side and the slender top of his jet-pack.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this gives him a pretty complex look that seems to be a stuffed
          together on all his adventures.

      <div className="fourwide">

          />
        </div>
        <h3>Mon Calamari Star Cruiser</h3>
        <p>
          Though it looks like there is little contrast in the Mon Calamari Star
          Cruisers, because they are made almost completely of rounded forms,
          their design works nearly by sheer contrast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foremost the forms are contrast to each other by their different size,
          than there is the contrast between curved forms and the edges where
          they intersect each other. This overall cohesive shape again is
          contrasted by the bridges and towers sticking out of it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="fourwide">
        <div>

          />
        </div>
        <h3>Cloud City</h3>
        <p>
          Cloud City just has this majestic look. Regardless that it&#8217;s so
          huge and massive it still looks like it&#8217;s really floating in the
          clouds. This is achieved through the extreme contrast between the
          enormous, heavy, flat disk at the top and this slender pole at the
          bottom that looks like it never could hold the weight of its top.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tricks our brain to asume, that if the pole doesn&#8217;t look
          like it could support the top, than it must be floating.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>
        <em>Reason &#8470;7</em> Variations If Ideas
      </h2>
      <p>
        A good way to make fictional designs more believable is to avoid making
        them look random. A good way to do so is giving them some kind of
        background and connecting them with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Star Wars this is done especially for the Imperial forces, with
        designs that build up on each other, making them look like they where
        from same line. This not just adds to their credibility but also gives
        them much more depth. In addition it contrasts to the Rebells, whose
        crafts and uniforms look much less organized and more like they were
        stuffed together from different sources.
      </p>
      <div className="sixwide">
        <div>
          <img
            src={imageImperialforces.src}
            title="Stromtrooper, Scout Trooper, AT-AT Pilot, TIE-Pilot"
            width="460"
            height="136"
          />
        </div>
        <h3>Stormtroopers &#038; Imperial Pilots</h3>
        <p>
          Everybody knows the classic Stromtrooper Uniform, but if you look
          closer, you will notice, that parts of their uniforms are picked up by
          other imperial forces. While some part of the standard Stromtrooper
          design is always obtained, some parts of the armor are altered for the
          differend professions to make them more suitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But overall, all these designs create a consistent look for the
          Imperial forces, increasing the recognizability and suggesting that
          there must be some kind of organizational structure. Furthermore,
          giving every soldier and pilot the same “face”, no matter what they
          do, adds to the impression of a faceless army where a single person is
          of no significance, like in an ant colony.

          There is a great Article on IGN called{' '}

        <h3>TIE-Series</h3>
        <p>
          The different TIE-models push the idea of altering a basic design even
          further. As already mentioned the look of the basic TIE-Fighter is
          pretty simple, making it easier to change details while maintaining
          the look and the recognizability.
        </p>
        <p>
          This strengths the feeling, that the design of these starfighters
          isn&#8217;t just random. It makes it look like the concept of the TIE
          has really been developed by some starfighter-designers at{' '}
          <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sienar_Fleet_Systems">
            Sienar Fleet Systems
          </a>
          , has proved itself successful and was used again and altered slightly
          to fulfill other purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you should also notice that you first need to really establish a
          concept before you can alter it. If in the first scene of Star Wars
          there would already be 3 different kinds of TIEs, and in the next
          scene 4 others, it would clearly lose its impact.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>
        <em>Reason &#8470;6</em> Functional Design
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you design anything fictional, it should fulfill at best two things:
        It should look cool and it should look like it could work or at least
        make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#8217;s pretty easy to design something that just looks cool, but if
        it creates the feeling that it wouldn&#8217;t be practical to actually
        use it, this will make it much less believable. And believability is
        pretty important for fictional things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus if something fantastic looks like it would actually work, it
        becomes even more fantastic.

        <h3>Rebell Blockade Runner</h3>
        <p>
          The Corellian corvette emphasis a look, that feels like it was
          designed for pure functionalty. Form follows purpose. There is no
          bodywork to shape it into something that looks good. The whole form is
          defined by its single components like the engines and the bridge. In
          addition there is no reason for an aerodynamic design, since you
          don&#8217;t need something like this in space.
        </p>
        <p>
          This generates a look, that fells like it was only designed to do its
          work, not to win a contest for the best looking spaceship and thus
          makes it so believable.

        <p>
          Unlike the Blockade Runner an R2-droid isn&#8217;t only used for pure
          practicle things like transportation. He is more like Personal
          Computer or a PDA. In fact he could be called something like a status
          symbol, thence he has to look good.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is reflected in his design which much more emphasizes a clear
          form. Nearly all the tools and utilities are hidden inside the casing
          of the droid making him something like an iMac or an Swiss Army Knife
          on Wheels. He has to function, but he also should look good. In the
          world of Star Wars he is something like a design object, still this
          good look fulfills a purpose and isn&#8217;t there for its own sake.

        <h3>Jabba The Hutt</h3>
        <p>
          Jabba is a good example for what happens if you use the freedom a
          fictional world gives you and create something that intentional
          doesn&#8217;t work.

        <p>
          He is a powerful crime lord but his arms are barely long enough to
          reach his mouth and his body is to fat to move on his own. But this
          doesn&#8217;t weaken the believe in his power. It even strengthens it.
          It is his preposterous look that gives him an intimidating appearance.
          You subconsciously assume, that if somebody is physically so feckless
          and yet such a powerful crime lord, there really must be something
          that grants his power. And you wouldn&#8217;t want to find out what.
        </p>
        <p>
          His physical weakness emphasis the political power he must possess.

      <h2>
        <em>Reason &#8470;5</em> Dirty/Used Look
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of the most revolutionary things about Star Wars when it came out
        was, that the things in the movies did look like they were used.
        Everything was dirty, sooty and worn-out. Before Star Wars it was more
        common for science-fiction-movies to look clean and futuristic. This
        look, that George Lucas called a “used universe”, heavily supports the
        believability of the Star Wars universe.
      </p>
      <div className="fourwide">
        <div>
          <img src={imageSlave1.src} title="Slave 1" width="300" height="190" />
        </div>
        <h3>Slave 1</h3>
        <p>
          The Slave 1 is just one example, representing most ships in Star Wars.
          It&#8217;s dirty, dented, sooty, worn, the paint chips off and there
          are traces of wear all over.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole look of this craft shows that it has been used and that its
          owner had more important things to do than polishing. This used look
          not just makes the thing more realistic, it tells a story. It brings
          the ship to life. You can really see that it has underwent several
          episodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today this look is pretty common, but in the 1960s it was a revolution
          and it adds enormously to the believability of Star Wars.

        <h3>Imperial Interior</h3>
        <p>
          Making things dirty gives opens up another great opportunity. Making
          things clean. If everything in the movies would be clean you just
          wouldn&#8217;t mind. Maybe you&#8217;d be bored by it but nothing
          more. But by showing that there is really dirt in this universe, they
          are putting much more emphasis on the things that are clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clean and sterile look of the Imperial forces only works because
          off all the other dirt in the movies. Only by this it can really
          convey its look and feel of a cold military force that don&#8217;t
          even has to get its hands dirty when blowing up an entire planet.

        </div>
        <h3>Tusken Raiders</h3>
        <p>
          The Tusken Raiders do something great for the overall feel of Star
          Wars. They show you, that not everything in this universe is
          futuristic and technological-advanced. Even in a world with Laser
          canons, Holograms and Hyperspace Drives, there are still primitive
          tribes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But their clothing isn&#8217;t just made of simple, savage materials.
          It seems like they use some simple technology, like their face-mask.
          But this doesn&#8217;t make them look high tech. The worn-out look of
          their clothing that clearly shows signs of handcraft and the
          manufacturing process gives them the feeling of a tribe that is just
          using some outdated stuff or something like this.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>
        <em>Reason &#8470;4</em> Breaking the rules
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are many rules on what is (supposed to be) good design and how to
        do it. I already told you 6 of them and how they where used in Star Wars
        to produce great designs. So here&#8217;s another rule:
      </p>
      <p className="singleline">Screw the rules!</p>
      <p>
        There is nothing more boring than a standard design that has been used
        several times before, so do something unexpected. Sometime it&#8217;s
        just best to do something unusual, or even something you were told never
        to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Star Wars makes great use of this. There are so many designs that are
        completely different to anything that had been there before (and after).
        Even small design choices can be approached in an usual way, making
        things more interesting.

        <p>
          This ship isn&#8217;t really well-know, but I just love the unusual
          look of it (note, that the bigger part ist the front of the ship),
          resembling an reversed gun. Nevertheless it still looks believable.
          The whole thing doesn&#8217;t seem to be that impressive, yet it
          isn&#8217;t that easy to do something that can be identified as a
          space ship without looking like anything we associate with a space
          ship.

        <h3>Chewbacca</h3>
        <p>
          Chewbacca is a co-pilot and looks like a huge dog-bear. On the one
          hand this is totally ludicrous. On the other hand he is one of the
          most favored characters. On the third hand this makes perfectly sense,
          because he wouldn&#8217;t be such a great and beloved character if he
          would have been just a normal human co-pilot.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>
        <em>Reason &#8470;3</em> Design inspired by existing things
      </h2>
      <p>
        Most people don&#8217;t notice this, but it is used pretty often
        throughout Star Wars. Many of the designs are based upon things that
        really exist. This can have two advantages: it can give the object a
        certain feeling because it creates an associativity if it is common or
        it can just make use of an established design that is known for creating
        a certain look or feeling.

      <h3>Blasters</h3>
      <div className="sixwide">

          Did you found the weapons of Star Wars somehow familiar? Like
          you&#8217;ve seen them before? That&#8217;s not by accident. All small
          arms in Star Wars are based upon existing weapons from the real world.

          The weapon on the top is a{' '}

          which was manufactured from 1896 to 1936 in Germany and was used
          amongst others by Winston Churchill and the German Army.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weapon on the bottom is a{' '}

            DL-44 heavy blaster pistol
          </a>{' '}
          which was manufactured in the time of the Galactic Civil War by
          BlasTech Industries and was used by Han Solo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you notice something about them? For Star Wars they just took
          Mausers and put some muzzle and grip accessories on it and mounted a
          rifle scope on the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somehow all this is also a part of George Lucas &#8220;used
          univers&#8221;. Because they used weapons that actually really work
          they made sure that they look believable and this added to their
          credibility.

          title="Darth Vader"

        />
      </div>
      <div className="sixwide">
        <p>
          I think nobody out there who hasn&#8217;t lived under a rock for the
          last 30 years has never seen Darth Vader. He&#8217;s a symbol for evil
          and probably the most famous of all Star Wars characters, if not of
          all (science-fiction-)movie characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure his heavy breathing and his deep, mechanical voice are a big part
          of what made him famous. Nevertheless one couldn&#8217;t neglect, that
          what most people associate with him are his black armor and his
          helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how many people know the roots of his famous outfit? In fact the
          main inspiration for the look of the dark lord of the Sith, especially
          for his helmet, was the armor of Japanese Samurai Warriors and a
          Stahlhelm, the helmet worn by German soldiers during World War II.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the great design of Darth Vader and the success it had is a
          great example for something, many designers don&#8217;t want to be
          true:
        </p>
        <p>
          You don&#8217;t have to work from absolutely nothing in order to
          create an innovative design. Far from it! Sometimes the best and most
          cutting-edge designs just come from new combinations and a new and
          unusual point of view at existing things. There is absolutely nothing
          wrong about working upon things that had been proved successful. You
          should just keep in mind the difference between inspiration and
          imitation.

        <em>Reason &#8470;2</em> Shape
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is something like the master-rule for good design. Whatever you do,
        no matter what, the quality of it will depend on whether or not it got a
        good and strong shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing you see from nearly every object, no matter if two- or
        three-dimensional, is its shape. Judging the shape is the fastest way
        your brain can grasp a thing. If you can recognize an object, depends
        strongly on whether you can recognize its shape. This doesn&#8217;t just
        mean, that things with dull shapes will be harder to recognize, it also
        means that they will be boring to look, which will affect the design
        negatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the sense of a good shape isn&#8217;t just to increase the
        recognition values of an object, it also supports the impression of it.
        The shape can convey if the object is large, small, fast, strong, heavy,
        hard and so forth. Thus making it one of the strongest weapons of a
        designer.

        To write something about the shapes in Star Wars would be an article for
        itself. But I think they are self explaining anyway. Just have a look at
        this collection of shapes from various crafts and persons from Star Wars
        and try if you can recognize them. Notice especially how good some
        objects are identifiable from different angles.
