      <h1><em>An introduction to the </em>Graphics Tablet</h1>

        Some people say they can paint with a mouse. Maybe because they never
        tried out a graphics tablet. Some people say they tried out a graphics
        tablet and they can&#8217;t handle it. Well, that could be true. But
        they should try more. It&#8217;s worth it. I tell you why!
      </p>
      <h2>Why should I use <em>one of these things?</em></h2>
      <div class="sixwide">
        <p>
          Some people may think, that a mouse suffices to use a graphic
          software. If the point is just to do some photo manipulating this may
          be right, but what if we want to paint?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&#8217;s face it. Moving a mouse doesn&#8217;t really feels like
          moving a brush. You can do neither wide movements with your whole arm
          nor work precisely with your fingers. Well, may be you can, but it
          will feel stiff and you just won&#8217;t get a flow, like you would
          with a real brush.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don&#8217;t believe me just try to draw something like a face
          on a piece of paper with a pencil and than try to draw it with your
          mouse on your computer. Even if you are pretty practiced with your
          mouse, this won&#8217;t feel like painting, will it? Just look at how
          you hold the mouse and how you hold a brush or a pencil. This
          can&#8217;t work.
        </p>

          <p>
            A graphics tablet (or digitizing tablet, graphics pad, drawing
            tablet) is a computer input device that allows one to hand-draw
            images and graphics, similar to the way one draws images with a
            pencil and paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            A graphics tablet consists of a flat surface upon which the user may
            &#8220;draw&#8221; an image using an attached stylus, a pen-like
            drawing apparatus.
          </p>

      <h2>
        <em>Maybe a mouse sucks, </em>but I also can&#8217;t handle <br />these
        grapics tablets
      </h2>
      <p>That may be right. At least at first.</p>
      <p>
        Most people have problems when first using a tablet. They won&#8217;t
        hit the things they are trying to click or have problems to move across
        the screen at all. That&#8217;s because there are mainly two issues
        using a tablet:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>1.</strong> Unlike a mouse the stylus isn&#8217;t projected
            relative to the screen. Instead it is projected absolute to the
            tablet.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you move a mouse up your table, pick it up, pull it back to you
            and move it up again, the cursor will move up two times. If you do
            the same with the stylus the cursor will jump back when you lift it
            from the tablet and move it where you started your movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you point the stylus to the upper right corner of your tablet,
            your cursor will jump to the upper right corner of your screen. If
            you point to the lower left corner on the tablet your cursor jumps
            to the lower left corner of your screen and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            This issue is confusing many people who use a graphics tablet for
            the first time. You are not pushing your cursor around the screen,
            you are pointing at the place you want.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>2.</strong> You don&#8217;t look at where you are drawing.
            You are looking on the screen while drawing in front of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn&#8217;t a real mouse vs. graphics tablet problem,
            it&#8217;s more like a graphics tablet vs. brush problem.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both problems have one thing in common: You get used to them.</p>
      <p>
        Sure, it feels strange and stiff at first, but there is just one thing
        you can do against them: practice. Try to draw with your tablet as much
        as you can and you will find it more and more natural. After some time
        you will be able to draw with the stylus like you do with a pencil.
      </p>
      <h2><em>What is</em> all this good for?</h2>
      <p>
        Apart from getting a natural feeling for painting and drawing on your
        computer (one you will never ever get with a mouse) there is another
        benefit you shouldn&#8217;t underestimate:
      </p>
      <p>
        Graphics Tablets are pressure sensitive. Some can also detect tilt or
        rotation of your stylus.
      </p>
      <p>
        So you get a third dimension (or even more) in addition to the
        horizontal and vertical position. Nearly all graphics software are able
        to interpret this information for several uses, like the size or opacity
        of your brush.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the greatest benefit of a tablet. It gives you the ability to
        imitate all kinds of pens and brushes. You can simulate paint brushes,
        as well as pencils, calligraphy pens or even stuff you couldn&#8217;t do
        analog at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        A graphic tablet is an essential tool if you really want to push the
        envelope of your graphic software, so you should really give them a
        chance.
