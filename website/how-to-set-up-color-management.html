        Color management is the one and only way to achieve perfect color
        reproduction across multiple devices. Color management systems are
        affordable and pretty easy to use today. But after you created a profile
        for your device, the job is not done. Setting up your application
        correctly is essential to exactly know how your pictures will look on
        the web or in print.
      </p>
      <h2><em>First things first</em> calibrate your devices</h2>
      <div class="sixwide">
        <p>
          To make sure your monitor displays all colors as correctly as
          possible, you have to calibrate them and create a color profile.
        </p>
        <h3 class="dontclear">Color management systems</h3>
        <p>
          A <abbr title="Color management system">CMS</abbr> is the best way to
          calibrate and profile your display. They will give you the best
          results and are pretty foolproof. Some of the most common
          <abbr title="Color management system">CMS</abbr>&#8216; are the

          >.
        </p>
        <h3 class="dontclear">On a Mac</h3>
        <p>
          Mac OS X has a good programm to calibrate your monitor without any
          expensive measuring device (but not that accurate).
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be found in
          <strong
            >Apple > System Preference > Displays > Color > Calibrate…</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>The program itself is self-explanatory.</p>
        <h3 class="dontclear">Testing images</h3>
        <p>
          While it is hard to test your
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature"
            >color temperature</a
          >
          and white luminance with the naked eye, you can at least check your
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction">gamma</a>
          manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://werbefoto.at/d_base/calibration.htm">Werbefotos.at</a>
          has some good images to find out and adjust your Gamma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, that this won&#8217;t produce a profile for your monitor!

          <p>
            In order to describe the behavior of the various output devices,
            they must be compared (calibrated) in relation to a standard
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color space</a>.
            Often a step called linearization is performed first, in order to
            get the most out of limited 8-bit color paths. Instruments used for
            measuring device colors include
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimeter">colorimeters</a>
            and spectrophotometers. As an intermediate result, the device
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">gamut</a> is described
            in the form of scattered measurement data. The measurement data
            (CGATS) is often not usable immediately. Such data need to be
            prepared for high speed conversions of the actual image data. The
            transformation of the scattered measurement data into a more regular
            form, usable by the application, is called profiling. Profiling is a
            complex process involving mathematics, intense computation,
            judgement, testing, and iteration. After the profiling is finished,
            an idealized color description of the device is created. This
            description is called a profile.

      <h2><em>How to setup your</em> operating system</h2>
      <p>After the calibration your profile should be applied automatically.</p>
      <p>
        Under Mac OS X you can check if everything is set up correctly in
        <strong
          >Apple > System Preference > Displays > Color > Display
          Profile</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Windows user this is a bit more difficult, because Windows itself
        can&#8217;t apply a color profile because Windows can&#8217;t really do
        color management. This makes an additional program necessary which
        typically comes with every
        <abbr title="Color management system">CMS</abbr> and is installed
        automatically. Make sure this program is in the autostart.
      </p>
      <h2><em>How to setup</em> Creative Suite</h2>
      <div class="sixwide">
        <p>
          Start Photoshop or any other CS application. Go to
          <strong>Edit > Color Settings…</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Your settings should look like these on the right.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>RGB:</strong> If you only work for the web you can choose
          sRGB, but if your work will probably be printed you should go with
          Adobe RGB, because it’s the bigger
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">gamut</a>. Never chose
          your monitor profile (even if many people think, that this is what
          should be chosen). This wouldn&#8217;t make sense, because your
          monitor profile is already applied by your graphics-card and would be
          run a second time over your image if you chose that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CMYK:</strong> Choose a standard CMYK Profile like Euroscale
          Coated v2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leave <strong>Gray</strong> and <strong>Spot</strong> as they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make shure you always know what&#8217;s happening deactivate all
          <strong>Color Management Policies</strong> and check
          <strong>Ask When Opening</strong>. This means, that always if a
          picture has no or a different color profile than your working space,
          you will be asked what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case you should either choose to keep the profile or to
          convert it to your working space (depends on what you want to do). If
          you have an image from the web with no profile you should assign sRGB,
          because images on the web are in the majority of cases in sRGB.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never, ever deactivate or turn off color management! This will screw
          things completely up!
        </p>
        <p>
          Save these settings under a name of your choice. To synchronize all CS
          applications open up Adobe Bridge and go to
          <strong>Edit > Creative Suite Color Settings…</strong> look for the
          profile you just saved and click Apply. Now all your CS applications
          will work with the same setting.

      <h2><em>The</em> “Save for Web”-Problem</h2>
      <div class="sixwide">
        <p class="firstline">
          Many people have the problem, that their colors change when they use
          the option “Save for Web”.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact they don&#8217;t change. They are just not displayed the right
          way while working in Photoshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default Photoshop applies your working space to your images, which
          is good for print work, but leads to a difference in color displaying.
          To make sure Photoshop displays the colors like an application, that
          don&#8217;t color manage (like your browser or your operating system)
          you have to check <strong>View > Proof Setup > Monitor RGB</strong>.
          Furthermore you have to check <strong>View > Proof Colors</strong>.
          Make sure this is always checked in every image you are working on
          (because its deactivated by default).
        </p>
        <p>
          When saving for the web you should also make sure to check
          <strong>Convert to sRGB</strong>, especially if you are not working in
          sRGB.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you work in Adobe RGB (or an other profile than sRGB) there could
          be a slight difference in color after Saving For Web because of the
          difference between Adobe RGB and sRGB. You can check your images by
          converting them manually to sRGB before saving for the web by clicking
          on <strong>Edit > Convert to Profile… > Profile: sRGB</strong>. Make
          sure you undo this step afterwards or you will keep on working in
          sRGB.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you follow these steps you will see your images in Photoshop
          exactly like in your browser. But now you are color managing to make
          sure your pictures will also look great in print.
