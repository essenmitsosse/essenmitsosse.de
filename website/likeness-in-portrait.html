    </div>

    <div class="content white">

      <p>
        In todays portrait-class I asked myself, what it is, that makes a
        drawing look like the person that you have drawn. What do you have to
        consider when you want to achieve resemblance, which factors are
        important? I did some experiments and found out some pretty interesting
        things.
      </p>
      <h2><em>It&#8217;s not about </em>the proportion</h2>
      <div class="sixwide">
        <p>
          Just look at the picture to the right. Can you recognize this person?
          I drew exactly over a photo of him, so the proportion should be quite
          correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless it&#8217;s not that easy to realize who this person is
          supposed to be. In fact, this portrait sucks pretty much even if the
          proportions are correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides caricatures wouldn&#8217;t work, if the proportions where that
          important for recognizing a face.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example look at the great paintings of
          <a href="http://sebastian-kruger-news.blogspot.com/"
            >Sebastian Krüger</a
          >. In most of his caricatures the proportions are completely displaced
          but you still won&#8217;t have any problem to identify the persons
          caricatured.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems like the relation between the size and distance of parts of
          the face are not that important for the recognition value of a face.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sixwide center">
        <img
          src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/whoisthis.jpg"
          alt="Who is this?"
          title="Who is this?"
          width="300"
        />
      </div>
      <h2>Creating Likeness <em>in a Portrait</em></h2>
      <div class="sixwide">
        <p>
          Now take a look at this picture. This time it should be quite easy to
          identify the person.
        </p>
        <h3>Is is because we can see more of the detail?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Even if you squint your eyes, making your view blurred you will
          still be able to recognize the person.
        </p>
        <h3>So it must have something to do with the light!</h3>
        <p>
          Yes and no. It&#8217;s not the light itself. If you could recognize a
          person because of the light, it would depend on the lightning, if you
          are able to identify someone or not. But you can identify a face you
          know under nearly every lightning condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the light shows you something else. Something we didn&#8217;t saw
          in the first line-drawing. It shows you the 3-dimensional volume of
          the face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone is able to identify someone from nearly every angle. Our
          brains seem to recognizes faces independently from the perspective in
          which we are seeing it. Our brains don&#8217;t remembers certain
          outlines, they remember the 3-dimensional form and the volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edges, corners, dints, furrows, coves, convex- and concavities. The
          ups and downs of a (sur-)face, how it arches and dips. All this
          characterizes a form. In case of a face this is what creates its
          likeness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why it is so hard to recognize the person from the shitty
          line-drawing above, which just shows outlines, but gives only a few
          clues about the 3-dimensional form itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But drawing lines along the shadow borders just don&#8217;t mean you
          are doing a good portrait.
        </p>
        <p>
          This picture shows the outline of the black &#038; white picutre
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the lines are running exactly along the shadow borders of the
          above picture, the likeness is completely destroyed. This kind of
          drawing just don&#8217;t make sense to our brain.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sixwide center">
        <img
          src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/whoisthis2.jpg"
          alt="Who is this?"
          title="Who is this?"
          width="300"
        /><br />
        <img
          src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/whoisthis3.jpg"
          alt="Who is this?"
          title="Who is this?"
          width="300"
        />
      </div>
      <h2><em>How to</em> line-draw a portrait</h2>
      <p>
        The line-drawing above shows you why computers can&#8217;t do art. A
        good drawing is neither made by just following the major outlines of a
        face, nor by following a shadow border.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither do you have to draw every single change of direction in the face
        nor can you just draw lines around the eyes, mouth and nose. You have to
        find the big and the important shapes and forms and you have to find
        lines to describe them 2-dimensional.
      </p>
      <p>
        But don&#8217;t think 2-dimensional.
        <strong
          >Try to imagine how the lines are running into the room, try to push
          them into the space.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Eyes or mouth are often drawn just as flat forms, but they got a volume
        that is important for their recognition, so you have to draw it. If the
        eyes of your drawing don&#8217;t look like the ones from your model, you
        probably just didn&#8217;t capture their subtle form and shape or gave
        no attention to their volume.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&#8217;s also why it&#8217;s so difficult to draw from a photo. You
        tend to draw just 2-dimensional shapes, ignoring the 3-dimensional form
        of the object. But you have to paint the volume.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more you are able to draw the volume instead of just flat shapes,
        the more you will notice, that your drawings will come to life, get more
        personality and will be easier recognized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to rescue a drawing by shading it fails most of the time. This is
        because if your lines don&#8217;t capture the form correctly, a shading
        won&#8217;t undo this mistake. So try to draw a face and only if the
        drawing works start shading it.
      </p>

      <h2><em>How to draw</em> a person from a photo</h2>
      <p>
        Don&#8217;t try to draw from just one photos. Try to get as much photo
        as possible of the person you are going to draw. The more references you
        have, the better you can try to understand the 3-dimensional form of the
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to imagine the head in 3 dimensions while drawing. Don&#8217;t just
        copy a photo.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2><em>A last hint for</em> caricatures</h2>
      <p>
        Try to exaggerate the 3-dimensional forms instead of 2-dimensional
        shapes. This will make your caricatures look much more realistic and
        increase the likeness of them.
