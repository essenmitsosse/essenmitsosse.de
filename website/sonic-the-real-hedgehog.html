          After the great success of my
          <a
            href="realistically-painted-bowser/indexff99.html?preview=1&amp;template=essenmitsosse-dreadnought&amp;stylesheet=essenmitsosse-dreadnought"
            >Realistically Painted Bowser</a

          I decided to do another realistic version of a famous videogame
          character.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time I tried to imagine how Sonic would look like if he would be
          a real hedgehog.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest challenge about this one was, that the original Sonic
          looks everything but realistic. He is so stylized, that it&#8217;s
          hard to tell if he is a hedgehog at all. This made it hard to find a
          middle course between the initial design and the look of a real
          hedgehog.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I would stick to much to the original it wouldn&#8217;t look pretty
          realistic, but if I would get to close to the actual animal one
          wouldn&#8217;t be able to identify him as Sonic.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was challenging, but also the most interesting part about doing
          this picture. Until the final design Sonic went thru several
          revisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end I decided to give him a color-pattern that resembles a West
          European Hedgehog but facial proportions that stick to Sonic himself.
          His white gloves and the red shoes he kept as another link to the
          original, but the shoes underwent a little redesign. In addition his
          body looks like that of a runner, making it more believable that he
          can run at such high speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally I did a little old-school pixel-graphic of how a realistic
          Sonic would look like in one of the old games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again the whole picture was painted using
          <a
            href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NDIBYG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=essencompucan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000NDIBYG"
            >Adobe Photoshop CS3</a
          >
          and my
          <a
            href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030097G?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=essencompucan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00030097G"
            >Wacom Intuos3 Pen Tablet</a
          >. No filters or any other stuff like that, just a round brush (mostly
          pressure-sensitive) and a little bit of the smudge tool. I also tried
          to keep the numbers of layers as low as possible and reduced them to
          the background-layer, if I could.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping my means simple and do everything manual gives me more control
          over what I do and the image gets a more picturesque look instead of
          the typical Photoshop look.
