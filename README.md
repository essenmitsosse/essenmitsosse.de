This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Before you start

Before you clone this repo, make sure to install
[Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

It is also recommended to install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (for
example via `brew install nvm`). Now you can use `nvm use` when inside the repo
to switch to the correct Node version.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
